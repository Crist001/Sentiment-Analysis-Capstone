"Assessment (by Cabinet Committee) showed that although Pakistan had extended a lucrative incentive package  the lack of investment interest in Gwadar Free Zone was “inexplicable”   ""Recommends revisiting Port Concessions Agreement with Chinese operators"" https://t co/4Vbzzc9h63"
The Pakistani official said that Pakistan's strategic Gwadar port developing under CPEC is being connected with the rest of the country through better road infrastructure to give impetus to the national economy and enhance regional connectivity and trade 
adding that the second phase of CPEC will connect private sectors of Pakistan and China  bring in more private investments  boost cooperation in agriculture and science and technology  and initiate an era of industrialization through the establishment of special economic zones 
"Bajwa said that CPEC has entered the second phase after the successful completion of the first  which has filled the voids of energy and communication infrastructure in the country   ""The impact of the second phase will be much larger than the phase one "" he said "

As crude prices rise: Iran-China $400 Billion oil deal in jeopardy Yuan needs more $ to sustain exchange rate vs  US$ CCP loses Forex faster  A deadly spiral  CPEC money dries  Pak dies faster   Saudi Wealth Fund director on RIL board  UAE's strategic oil reserve in India   1/2
Indian Conspiracy  Indian Jealousy  Indian Alif Laila   All these are a loser’s argument  The truth is that the Pakistani Govt is incompetent and corrupt  both  It is elements within the Pakistani Government that have sabotaged CPEC  China’s flagship venture is now on ventilator  https://t co/xsEzv5z8aa
@fufandoo @Alkhidr108 The theory is  China wants CPEC via Afghanistan  But for that to happen  Gwadar &amp; Chabhar Port are 2 options  China in talks with Baloch Freedom Movement  to recognise them as a country  In returns China will get resources  Once that over  China will reach directly via Panjshir 
@rishi_suri @smitaprakash @IamNaveenKapoor @SuriNavin @sameepshastri @Wangu_News18 @IshanDhar Pakistan's inflationary scenario has been spiraling down since 2018; push that it's India's conspiracy through the FATF greylist hasn't convinced anyone  CPEC and Khan's economic ineptitude is a dizzying double whammy  A stifling dependence on China bound to increase 
CPEC in doldrums  no work done in last three years  #CPEC #Pakistan  
China gave #CPEC loans to pakistan costlier than most institutional lenders like World Bank  Japan  IMF  Asian Bank or other  Japan lends at 1 %  WB at 2-3%  China lent at mind-blowing 4% rate  Sheer hypocrisy of friendship   
@Hamood_stfu China can easily waive off high rates for Pakistan where it has invested heavily in CPEC and most of its ambitions lie  Yet they've decided to make extra pennies out of your pockets

The Skardu airbase is almost 200 kilometers from both Leh and Srinagar in India  This airbase not only offers Pakistan strategic capability extension in the area but also provides a standpoint to keep an eye on the crucial China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects

@kaalakawaa One big difference is that there is an Afghan Taliban govt in Kabul  IF negotiations can achieve some kind of enduring peace in the border tribal regions it’s a win-win for all stakeholders  We need peace for CPEC to work and for trade to Central Asia/ex Russia

#Modi Govt lacks vision &amp; Spine to counter🇨🇳China !  Why India never objected China naming project passing through PoK(which belong to India)as CPEC #ChinaPakistanEconomicCorridor #CPEC name was part of Chinese strategy to show🌐Kashmir belongs to Pakistan 
#StandWithAfghanistan  Afghanistan’s increased reliance on CPEC proves the viability of the N-CPEC+ proposal for expanding this corridor further northwards deeper into Central Asia through the trilateral railway that’s planned between them and Uzbekistan
